            "title": "Introduction to Variables",
            "explanation": "A variable is a container for storing data values. In Python, you create a variable the moment you first assign a value to it. For example, `x = 5` creates a variable named `x` and stores the number 5 in it.",
            "question": "Create a variable named `player_name` and assign it the value 'Alice'.",
            "answer_keywords": ["player_name", "=", "'Alice'", '"Alice"']

            "title": "Working with Strings",
            "explanation": "A string is a sequence of characters, used for text. You create a string using single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). For example, `greeting = 'Hello'`.",
            "question": "Create a variable called `first_word` and assign it the string 'Programming'.",

            "title": "Working with Numbers",
            "explanation": "Python has two main number types: integers (whole numbers, like 10) and floats (numbers with a decimal, like 3.14). You don't need to declare the type; Python figures it out automatically.",
            "question": "Create a variable called `player_score` and assign it the integer value 100.",
