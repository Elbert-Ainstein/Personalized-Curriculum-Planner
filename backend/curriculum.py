            "title": "Introduction to Variables",
            "explanation": "A variable is a container for storing data values. In Python, you create a variable the moment you first assign a value to it. For example, `x = 5` creates a variable named `x` and stores the number 5 in it.",
            "question": "Create a variable named `player_name` and assign it the value 'Alice'.",

            "title": "Working with Strings",
            "explanation": "A string is a sequence of characters, used for text. You create a string using single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). For example, `greeting = 'Hello'`.",

            "explanation": "Python has two main number types: integers (whole numbers, like 10) and floats (numbers with a decimal, like 3.14). You don't need to declare the type; Python figures it out automatically.",

            "explanation": "A linear equation is an equation where the variable is only to the first power (no exponents). To solve `x + 3 = 7`, subtract 3 from both sides to get `x = 4`.",
            "question": "Solve for x: `x + 5 = 12`.",

            "title": "Understanding Functions",
            "explanation": "A function is a rule that takes an input and gives an output. For example, `f(x) = x + 2` means if you put in 3, you get 5 (because 3 + 2 = 5).",
            "question": "If `f(x) = x + 2`, what is `f(4)`?",
